# Student-by-BST
1) Read file that reads student records from a text file and stores them according to the student id in a binary search tree (BST).
   The function prints to screen the number of student records successfully read.
2) Deepest Node in BST class that finds and prints all the nodes at the deepest level.
3) Display in BST class that traverses a BST tree recursively and print the content of every node.

   The order variable is to specify if user want to print in ascending or descending order according to id.
   Use order = 1 for ascending and order = 2 for descending.
   The source variable is used to specify where to print the output.
   Use source = 1 to print to screen and source = 2 to print to a file name “student-info.txt”.
