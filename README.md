# Student-by-BST
1) Read data to BST that reads student records from a text file and stores them according to the student id in a binary search tree (BST).
   The function prints to screen the number of student records successfully read.
2) Print deepest nodes in BST class that finds and prints all the nodes at the deepest level.
3) Display student in BST class that traverses a BST tree recursively and print the content of every node.

   The order variable is to specify if user want to print in ascending or descending order according to id.
   Use order = 1 for ascending and order = 2 for descending.
   The source variable is used to specify where to print the output.
   Use source = 1 to print to screen and source = 2 to print to a file name “student-info.txt”. 
   
4) Clone Subtree that will clone a subtree in t1 where the root of the subtree contain value item.
5) Print Ancestor to print all the ancestors for item.
6) Print Spiral that will print all the nodes in a BST in spiral order.
